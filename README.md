# Fullstack Project 3 Wild Code School Biarritz : Lunetic

## First step

- Create a "lunetic-front" folder and a "lunetic-back" folder in your IDE

- In your terminal, create a clone of the "Lunetic_front" Github repository in the "lunetic-front" folder that you just created:
  git clone git@github.com:Christelle-Legros/Lunetic_front.git

- You also have to clone the "Lunetic_back" Github repository in the "lunetic-back" folder that you just created:
  git clone git@github.com:Christelle-Legros/Lunetic_back.git

## Second step

- In your terminal, you need to do an "npm install" in your terminal in order to install the dependencies that we need to run the app, for both Lunetic_front and Lunetic_back repo (make sure to change your current directory in your terminal to Lunetic_front/Lunetic_back BEFORE npm install)

## Third step

- Run the app with "npm run dev" for Lunetic_front and "npm start" for Lunetic_back

- Enjoy!
